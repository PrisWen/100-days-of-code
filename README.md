# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

I started following various data science channels in the Python language and I was very interested in completing the 100 days of code challenge. I will upload my progress day by day and improve my skills working with Jupyter notebooks


## Day 0 : Apr 26 , 2020 | Challenge Starting peparation

**Today's Progress :** In order to complete this challenge I chose to start with freeCodeCamp.org because there are a lot of available courses and videos related with Data Science.
